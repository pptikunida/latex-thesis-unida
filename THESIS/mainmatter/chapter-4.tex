		\subsection{Description 1}
		The evolution of modern educational materials has seen a significant shift towards interactive technologies, with methods such as QR code integration being developed to enhance discovery learning in topics like mathematical probability\footcite{ramadhan2024}. However, the success of such technological integration is not merely dependent on its novelty, but on the core principles of functionality and usability, which dictate how effectively a user can interact with the system to achieve a desired outcome\footcite{goodwin1987}. Underpinning these user-facing features is the critical importance of a well-designed data structure, often a relational database, which is fundamental for managing the resources, whether for an online bookstore or a complex learning platform\footcite{alhusain2016}.
