	\section{Research Model}
	The research model employed for the development of this web-based platform follows a structured design methodology, encompassing several distinct phases from requirements analysis to final implementation. The initial phase involved a detailed analysis of system functionalities, which were defined through the creation of use case diagrams and their corresponding scenarios to capture user interactions accurately\footcite{taufan2022}. Following this, the system architecture was designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure a clear separation between the data layer, business logic, and the user interface, a common practice in building adaptive web systems\footcite{hidayat2012}. The implementation phase was then carried out using the Laravel framework, a modern toolset well-suited for developing online information systems\footcite{prawito2020}. This phased approach is aligned with established software engineering principles, providing a systematic workflow from concept to a functional application\footcite{sommerville2016}.
	all of that is in accordance with figure~\ref{fig:contoh-f}
